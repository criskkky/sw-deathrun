### How it works? 🤨
Once the plugin is loaded, it requires at least two players to start the game. The configuration is already set, so you don’t need to worry about it. The plugin will automatically adjust team limits, round time, player speed, and more, allowing you to focus on playing and having fun.

For those who are not familiar with Deathrun, it’s a minigame where CTs must navigate through traps while Ts must activate them. The last CT alive wins the round. After each round, a random CT is selected to become the next "Death" (T).
